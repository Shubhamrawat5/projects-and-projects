Our topic highlights the effects of Corona Virus on people in the recent times, causing a large scale disruption and claiming several lives.
Nearly 1.53 million people have been diagnosed in India alone till now. The virus hasn’t just given rise to various economic and life threatening issues, it has also affected  other activities which were going smoothly before.
Now the thing is, before the vaccine arrives in the market the virus is not the actual problem rather the spread of the virus is the major issue which can be tackled. Evidently Lockdowns are not the optimal solutions. So we did ask ourselves what is. The major cause of virus spread is the presence of more number of people in a place than actually required which sends all the social distancing protocol down the drain. But what if there was a way through which we could determine the number of people already present in a place so a visitor can choose whether to go there or not. Our website is just a simple but quite effective implementation of the above mentioned solution. This website provides you with an online portal through which you can book slots beforehand and hence save travel time and prevent chaos.
The first implementation provides a portal for booking slots for vaccination(when vaccine of the virus arrives) for all your family which also provides other features such as giving you details about the nearest vaccination camp, its location and number of people already present there. This will help the government to use its resources in an optimized manner:
1)	Travel time of people would be saved and since the whole registration and authentication process is online it will only take minutes for the vaccination process so the process of making India Covid-free would be much faster
2)	Due to strict authentication process it will prevent wastage and also stop black marketing of the vaccine since it will be quite valuable
3)	Provides an easier way for the government to keep track of the spread status of Corona virus amongst various states of India 
4)	Prevents crowding at a particular camp

This idea of booking slots is highly popular and we use it daily without even realizing it. For example, imagine travelling on a train without pre-booking a ticket. It’s going to be quite a risky affair, right? The same will happen if we don’t use slot-booking for other essential activities.
Think about the fact if we had this system at the time of demonetization. How many man-hours could have been saved. It would have also prevented the inconvenience that was endured by the citizens of India.
So, we also tried to implement this idea on a small scale which can be used at other places as-well.
After restoration of our daily routines and reopening of schools and colleges, sports activities will certainly be reduced. In our own college there are hundreds of students who visit the indoor hall daily. How could such a crowd be controlled? Well there also a slot booking window can be used, which will serve the purpose of not letting the place get overcrowded and simplifies the whole process.
